# Breakout
Breakout, more commonly known as brick breaker, is a game where the user controls a paddle that can move horizontally, trying to keep a ball from
falling out of bounds, and also trying to break all of the bricks in the level. There are multiple levels, and also powerups that can alter the
ball or the paddle itself.
