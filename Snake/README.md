# Snake
Snake is a game where the user starts as a small snake, eating the obstacles in its path to become a bigger snake. The object of the game is to try and
grow in size as large as possible, only winning if your body is as large as the grid that the game is played on. You can lose if the snake crashes
into a wall or a part of its own body.

The main purpose of this project was to utilize ArrayLists and see the advantages it has over using Arrays. The SoundDriver and GameDriver classes were
provided by my then teacher, Jonathan Gonzales.
